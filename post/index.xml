      <description>If you work in the IT industry, you probably have heard one of the following statements:
 I store my files in the Cloud. The application runs on the Cloud. All of my servers are in the Cloud.  But what is the Cloud?
The Cloud is an IT paradigm that allows on-demand availability of computational resources and data stores without direct active management by the user.
That&amp;rsquo;s it, thank you for reading!</description>

      <description>In computing, a log is an activity record generated by a system event. Logs are highly useful for monitoring, traceability, analyzing, verification, and to measure all activities related to the system.
There is a misconception that debugging is the same as logging. It is not. Debug messages are usually cryptical and only make sense for those who wrote them. Logs are not just for developers but for support teams, auditors, system administrators, basically for everyone that interacts with the system.</description>
