      <description>In computing, a log is an activity record generated by a system event. Logs are highly useful for monitoring, traceability, analyzing, verification, and to measure all activities related to the system.
There is a misconception that debugging similar to logging. It is not. Debug messages are usually cryptical and only make sense for those who wrote them. Logs are not just for developers but for support teams, auditors, system administrators, basically for everyone that interacts with the system.</description>
